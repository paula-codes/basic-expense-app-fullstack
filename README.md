## Basic Expense Tracker App
A very basic, full stack expense tracker app.
The aim was to practice working with `spring boot` framework and build UI with `reactJS` as well as RESTful routes.

## Stack
- `java` & `spring boot` - backend
- `reactJS` - frontend
- `h2` in-memory database
- `intelliJ` & `VScode` - code editors
